Slides etc for "Are the Bad Guys Already in Your Software Supply Chain" as presented at THREATCON1, 2025-09-22.

Video recording will be linked here when available.

The PDF in this repo will download but if you try to view it in-browser you may get some weird "Unable to render code block" error from GitHub. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If it really is messed up I will also have the slides in my personal domain: https://novarese.net/talks/

My other slides etc are cataloged in https://github.com/pvnovarese/talks
